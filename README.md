# Music_Generation
An LSTM-based RNN model that generates music by learning patterns from MIDI files. The project uses TensorFlow and music21 to preprocess data, train the model, and create original music compositions in MIDI format.

# ðŸŽµ Music Generation with RNN

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to generate music. Trained on MIDI files, the model learns musical patterns and produces original note sequences in MIDI format.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- **Model Type:** LSTM-based RNN
- **Libraries Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, music21, NumPy
- **Input:** MIDI file note sequences
- **Output:** Generated MIDI compositions


Install the dependencies using pip

 How to Run
	1.	Add your dataset of MIDI files in a directory.
	2.	Update the script (music_generation_pjt.py) to point to your dataset path.
	3.	Run the script
